# post.visualizations
Visualization Website for the Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker (POST) team of AguaClara. This app is used by AguaClara plant operators to visualize their plant performance data submitted with the post.collect application. 

## Developing
We use both [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) to build a web app that we can send to the [Playstore here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aguaclara.post.visualizations). Jekyll enables us to reduce code duplication by using include statements and layouts, and organizes our website/app structure. Jekyll reads the _config.yml document located in the root of the repo to determine which folder jekyll uses as source. When Jekyll is ran, it will build the resulting website in a statically accessible manner in the specified destination folder (the www folder). Therefore only files in the "source" folder should be edited, whereas editing a file in the "www" folder will just get overwritten the next time Jekyll is ran to build the static site. Once you are done editing a source file, you can test the code by running `jekyll serve` to start a server on your localhost (you must have [Jekyll installed locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for this to work). Once satisfied, you can build the apk using the cordova command line tool with the following command: `cordova build android`. That will generate a development apk.
